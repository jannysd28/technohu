I want to build a web-based platform that serves as a global opportunity hub for tech talents, allowing users to upload, run, preview, and buy/sell scripts, GUI apps, and web applications in a secure and scalable environment. The goal is to create a flexible job and code marketplace where anyone can showcase their tech skills, sell useful tools, or request custom development work.

🧑‍💼 User Roles & Registration
Two registration paths: "Register as Buyer" or "Register as Seller."

Users can later switch roles between buyer and seller.

A unified profile includes name, location (with flag), avatar, and role status.

🛒 Seller Dashboard
Upload entire folders or files containing CLI tools, GUI apps, or web apps.

Required input fields: Title, Description, Price, Command Inputs, and Language Tags.

Upon upload:

The system automatically scans the folder for environment info (e.g., requirements.txt, package.json).

The uploaded code is tested in a sandboxed environment that supports any language or framework.

Files are securely isolated and executed using containerization (Docker).

Buttons:

Run Preview – Executes app in sandbox with default working directory set to the uploaded folder.

Scan with Antivirus – Sends content to an antivirus API (e.g., VirusTotal).

Buy Now

Display buyer requests, with unique IDs and confirmation buttons. Confirmed requests increment "Active Work" counters.

A daily limit of 5 pitches to buyers (with optional paid upgrade to unlimited pitching).

🛍️ Buyer Dashboard
Browse and test uploaded content (scripts, apps).

Run scripts with command-line input, and GUI/web app previews via sandbox environment.

Ability to make custom job requests to sellers:

Fill in job description and proposed price.

A 10% platform fee is added automatically.

Display "Active Jobs" with real-time counter updates.

View seller profiles and initiate communication via "Pitch" system.

🖥️ Execution Environment
Fully sandboxed, containerized runners for all major languages and environments.

CLI support: stdin input via web interface.

GUI/Web apps: previewed via embedded VNC or browser iframe.

Auto-install dependencies via standard package managers.

Files are scoped to uploaded folder (virtual root).

📬 Communication & Request System
Sellers can pitch buyers (5x daily or unlimited via subscription).

Buyers can send custom requests to any seller (unlimited).

Requests include job description, proposed price, and status tracking.

Each request has a unique ID to avoid duplication in counters.

Pitches and requests are tracked in both user dashboards and the admin panel.

💳 Payments & Transactions
Platform charges:

10% fee on all buyer payments.

10% fee on all seller earnings.

Paid features: Unlimited pitching, optional antivirus scan.

Integrated escrow system: funds are released to seller only upon buyer confirmation.

Optional dispute resolution system managed by platform admin.

 Seller Marketplace Browser
Feature Name: Seller Explorer / Marketplace Feed

Functionality:

Buyers see a scrollable list/grid of all active sellers and their uploaded content.

Each seller card shows:

Profile picture & country flag

Seller name and short status (availability)

Featured uploads: thumbnails, titles, prices

Ratings, reviews, and verification status

Clicking a seller opens their public profile page:

All their uploaded scripts/apps

“Run Demo,” “Buy Now,” and “Send Request” buttons

Request form to initiate custom work

Filters and Sorting:

Filter by category (CLI, GUI, Web App)

Sort by price, rating, recency

Search by title, keyword, or tag

Technical Note:

Powered by a seller index with caching for performance

Supports pagination or infinite scrolling
it should show both active and no active in the market space

🌍 Location & VPN Detection
Auto-detect user’s country using IP geolocation.

Display flag and country name on profile.

VPN/proxy users are marked as “Unknown ❓”.

🧾 Ratings, Reviews & Trust
Buyers can leave ratings and short reviews after transactions.

Sellers gain badges based on completion rates and consistency.

Verified accounts via email or ID (optional).

⚙️ Admin Dashboard
View and manage:

All users, uploads, messages, pitches, and requests.

Site performance metrics and sandbox resource usage.

Suspensions, messages, disputes.

Download any uploaded content for moderation.

Message any user directly.

Monitor pitches/requests and platform revenue.

🔄 Flexibility & Growth
Both buyers and sellers can toggle availability (Active / Busy / Unavailable).

Users can write a 50-word status update.

Users can switch between buyer and seller roles from their profile.

Future support for:

Auto-translated profiles

AI code summary previews

One-click deployment to hosting services (e.g., Replit, Render)
