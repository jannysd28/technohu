Automated Execution and Preview Pipeline
To achieve this functionality, consider the following components:

1. Environment Detection and Configuration
Dependency Identification: Upon upload, the system scans for common dependency files such as requirements.txt for Python, package.json for Node.js, or Gemfile for Ruby. This allows the platform to identify the necessary packages and dependencies automatically.

Language and Framework Detection: Analyze file extensions and content to determine the programming language and framework used. For instance, .py indicates Python, .js for JavaScript, and so on. This aids in selecting the appropriate runtime environment.

2. Containerized Execution Environment
Docker Integration: Utilize Docker to create isolated environments for each upload. This ensures that code runs securely without affecting the host system. Each container can be configured based on the detected language and dependencies.

Resource Management: Implement resource limitations within containers to prevent excessive usage, ensuring fair resource distribution among users.

3. Automated Build and Deployment
Continuous Integration Tools: Integrate tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD to automate the build and deployment process. These tools can be configured to trigger upon file upload, initiating the environment setup and deployment automatically.

Preview Generation: After deployment, generate a preview URL that users can access to interact with the application. This can be achieved by routing the container's exposed port to a subdomain or unique URL.

4. Web-Based Preview Interface
Embedded Viewers: Incorporate web-based viewers or terminals to allow users to interact with CLI tools or view GUI applications directly within the browser. Tools like WebTTY or noVNC can facilitate this functionality.

Security Measures: Ensure that all interactions are sandboxed and monitored to prevent malicious activities. Implement measures like input validation, output sanitization, and activity logging.
